# Chapter 1: What Is Happening Hereâ€¨

This chapter explains the basic mechanisms of jQuery and provides examples of code which is used frequently. Such examples include simple animations, altering the text on a page (e.g. in a quiz) and more complicated versions of Chapter 0 examples. We discuss collections aka jQuery sets, basic chaining, and what methods can and cannot be chained.

In Chapter 2 we will move on to more advanced methods for this.
