# Chapter 0: Just Get Me Going

jQuery is a library of functions & you need a copy. </br>
There are two ways to get a copy of jQuery – you can link to an online copy in a CDN (Content Delivery Network) or you can download a copy and link to your own copy inside your script. 
I will show you both ways.  Both ways work; you decide!  

The other decision you need to make is whether you want to always access the most recent version of jQuery (via a CDN), or whether you want to stick to a specific version, so that your code won’t be effected by future updates. 

To keep things simple, we will download the current version (3.4.1 as of this writing)  and store it in the same folder as our webpages.  That also means that we have decided to stick to a specific version. 

All downloads may be found at https://jquery.com/download/ and we will download the compressed or minified version  at https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.min.js   (You can see the ‘min’ for minified in its URL.   It is missing comments, etc.  and, at another time, you may find it interesting to look at the uncompressed, development version.)
