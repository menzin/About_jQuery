# Chapter 9: What Next?

## Animations

To me this is probably the least interesting aspect of jQuery that we haven't touched on. The topic includes things like fading, have show or hide execute slowly, having elements slide up and down. The jQuery api lumps all these methods under Effects. https://api.jquery.com/category/effects/ 

## UI (User Interface) widgets and methods

The number of user-interface widgets is so large that they live in a separate project at https://jqueryui.com/. There is code and documentation for each interaction style (e.g. to make an element draggable or resizable) and widget (accordions, date-pickers, etc.) as well as code outlines for styling buttons, checkboxes, etc. It's worth going to the site to see what is available.

## jQuery Mobile 

Another separate project at https://jquerymobile.com/ which does for mobile devices (e.g. touch=enable) what jQuery did for the desktop.

## Plug-ins

As you might expect with a library as popular as jQuery, there is an enormous ecosystem of plug-ins that have been written for jQuery users. The official jQuery Registry of plug-ins is at https://plugins.jquery.com/ and that is an excellent place to browse and get a sense of what is available. Increasingly, many of these plug-ins are also available at npm and the Registry page recommends browsing there – i.e. at https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:jquery-plugin. That said, this kind of search will yield close to two thousand hits, so you will probably want to make a more focused search there. 

You can learn how to write and publish your own plug-ins in both the "Learning jQuery" and "jQuery in Action" books (see next page) and there are instructions for publishing them on npm at https://blog.npmjs.org/post/111475741445/publishing-your-jquery-plugin-to-npm-the-quick
