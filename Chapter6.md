# Chapter 6: Events

Management of event handlers is one of JQuery's strengths. As intermediate web development frequently goes lightly on this topic, we begin with a review of events, which goes deeper than our reviews of other topics.

## Review of Events

_**Browser and Mouse Events**_ <br>

There are many events built into the browser API – most notably **click**, **blur**, **focus**, **mouseup**, **mousedown**. The structure for all is similar, so we will focus on the click event. There are other events associated with the document, such as its being loaded. We will not be discussing them here. 

- **An event listener** <br>
    Listens for an event to happen and then fires an **event handler**. Many people use the terms event listener and event handler as synonyms (though not always.)
