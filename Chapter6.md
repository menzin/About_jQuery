# Chapter 6: Events

Management of event handlers is one of JQuery's strengths. As intermediate web development frequently goes lightly on this topic, we begin with a review of events, which goes deeper than our reviews of other topics.

## Review of Events

_**Browser and Mouse Events**_ <br>

There are many events built into the browser API – most notably **click**, **blur**, **focus**, **mouseup**, **mousedown**. The structure for all is similar, so we will focus on the click event. There are other events associated with the document, such as its being loaded. We will not be discussing them here. 

_**An event listener** _<br>

Listens for an event to happen and then fires an **event handler**. Many people use the terms event listener and event handler as synonyms (though not always.)
  
We also speak interchangeably of **adding an event listener** or **registering an event handler**; both expressions mean that we have specified what happens when a particular event happens.

For browser and mouse events, those events typically are associated with an action (such as a click or a mouseover) and an element where it takes places.  So the event handler will specify what happens when that action happens to that element; the event handler then becomes a property/attribute of the element and the name of that property tells you the action- e.g. `someElement.onclick`
